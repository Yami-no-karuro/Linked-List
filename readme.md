# C - Linked List 

## Introduction  

In computer science, a **Linked List** is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.  
Instead, each element points to the next.  
It is a data structure consisting of a collection of **nodes** which together represent a sequence.  
In its most basic form, each node contains data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

For more details, see the [Wikipedia page on Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).
